            BUGTRONS began with a mindset of encouraging community folks and
            make them aware of the Ed-tech industry by putting emphasis on
            problem-solving, code efficiency, code optimization, and logic-based
            programming. We empower hackers to get influenced by developing
            software, enhancing skills, solving bugs & producing opportunities.
